# My skills, interests and limitations
A summary for group software project

### Skills and Technologies
* C++ - The language of preference, I like it for its efficiency 
* Python - The second language of preference, I appreciate its simplicity of use and universality
* Java - The language I can use it when it is necessary
* Haskell - The language that taught me functional programming (a good puzzle for a programmer)
* Linux - The system I learn to use which is much more difficult than Windows. My goal is to be able to easily program software on that system, and I already learned a lot. I am also good at troubleshooting problems on that system - Many times I managed to solve some problems after hours or days of struggle, doing deep research on the internet, which is not easy due to the system's little popularity
* SQL - Basic usage
* Git - Basic usage
* Fast research - I am good at googling stuff, usage of technologies and solutions to problems
* Vim - Basic usage
* 2d and 3d graphics design - I can both edit 2d graphics to some point and create 3d models

### Interests
* QT - I would like to learn the QT library in order to include graphical user interfaces in my future c++ programs
* 2d and 3d graphics programming - I often code something with 2d graphics, and I want to dive deeper into that subject. I also would like to learn coding 3d graphics(like OpenGL) but it is a far future and unsure plan because of its complexness.
* game development - I like the idea of programming simple video games. So far I managed to implement raycasting in c++ and I would like to develop that concept in the future. I also currently develop my own graphical implementation of Conway's Game of Life
* Utility software - I also enjoy coding simple programs for solving simple tasks, like a mathematical graph visualizer, a note taking program, a graphical analog clock or a command-line file explorer. I have plans for much more, like ms paint and notepad clones.

### Limitations
* procrastination - I often procrastinate very much. The often the subject is not interesting for me, the more I will procrastinate - that means that if I'm good at or like some task, I will probably procrastinate less
* little experience with large / object oriented systems - most of programs I wrote are very simple and despite I know how to write Object Oriented Code and use it sometimes, I am not really experienced with creating really big systems that are based on OOP.
